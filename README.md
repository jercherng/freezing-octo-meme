Boostrap Practice Repo

Trying out the various commands of bootstrap at the moment. 
Things I've learnt so far:
1. if in your css file you write something like: '.myPanel.heading', it will look for something with both classes myPanel and heading. This is not cascading. To cascade, you need a space in between the two classes. Also, have not figured out how to make the color of 'brand' in index.html blue color. 

2. Remember to include http: in front of the links to include ftemplates from BootstrapCDN. Same goes for the scripts

Things I need to learn:
1. How do I download/upload a font onto server so that the computer visiting my website doesn't need to install the font? 

2. Figure out what does installing Bootstrap on my computer does. 

3. Figure out what are the components that are used in building bootstrap (? not sure if I'm saying this right). Need to learn about Node.js, bower, how to use gitignore.io, grunt, jade, install slim, all that good stuff. 

That's all for now, if you're reading this, thanks for reading it. Lol .
